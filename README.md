# Distributed-System

The course is offered in Spring 2018.

* MP1: In this MP, we implemented a distributed log system, where a central query machine receives and then outputs logs combined from each distributed machine in the cluster. We use Python as our main language for development.
* MP2: In this MP, we implemented a distributed group membership system using SWIM, where every machine keeps a full membership list, and keep pinging other machine to get update.
* MP3: In this MP, we implemented a distributed file system similar to HDFS. Each node has a part of the entire dataset, and each data piece is replicated at 4 machines. Note that we do not use a centralized master in the design.
* MP4: In this MP, we implemented Crane, a distributed data stream processing system, using Python that has functionalities similar to those of Spark Streaming.
