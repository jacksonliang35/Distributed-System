Distributed Grep

Files:
	new_server.py: listen on the server machine
	new_client.py: fetch the data from the server

Instructions:
	1. On each machine, go to the folder where new_server.py located and run the following command:
		# python new_server.py
	2. Put the log file under the same folder as the new_server.py
	3. On one of the machine, run the new_client.py. 
	   It accept 3 arguments: [#machines] [pattern] [file_name]. 
	   [#machines] is the number of machines you want to run grep. (start from the virtual machine #1)
	   [pattern] is the grep pattern including the flag. 
	   [file_name] is the name of the file that grep is running on, excluding the extension and file number (The file extension have to be .log).
	   e.g. # python new_client 3 'INFO' vm

Outputs:
	M1: command sent => 'grep ERROR test1.log'
	M2: command sent => 'grep ERROR test2.log'
	M1: L8:ERROR [2018-09-01 root : Hi]				/* This is the 
	M2: L10:ERROR [2018-09-02 root : Hi]				* grep result
	M1: L15:ERROR [2018-09-01 root : What's up]			*/					
	-----------
	M1: total line count 2						/* Line count for every machine
	M2: total line count 1
	M3: connection failed						/* Connection failed (also will report the command execution failure where the message is "command execution failed")
	Total Line Count: 3						/* Totoal line count from all the machines

Testing:
	1. Go to vm1, vm2 and vm3, run the log_data_generator.py as following
		# python log_data_generator.py [num] 
		where [num] is number of the current virtual machine
	2. start the new_server.py on vm1, vm2 and vm3
	3. run the test.py
		# python test.py
	
Test Logs:
	Log format:
	[Type] [[Time]] [user] : [message]
	e.g.
	INFO [2018-09-02] root : Hi
	
	1.[Type] can be "ERROR", "WARNING",or "INFO"
	# Error is rare: [1,2]
	# Warning is somewhat frequent: 1 - #Error - #Info
	# Info is frequent: [total_number/2 + 1, total_number -5]

	2. [Time] is "[2018-09-{num}]" where {num} is the number of current virtual machine

	3. [user] can be "root", "user1", or "user2"
	# root is frequent: [1,total_number]
	# user1 is only on odd-number virtual machine
	# user2 is only on even-number virtual machine

	4. [message] can be "Hello", "Hi", or "What's up"
	   They are randomly distributed
